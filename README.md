# Study Buddy

Study Buddy is an app designed to help students connect with each other to set up study times either virtually or in person. Incorporating the MVC model, JS, jQuery, Node, Sequelize, MySql, Express, Handlebars, Multer, Nodemailer, and a motivational API allows the user to create a profile with their picture, choose how many study buddies they want, where they want to meet (or not), zodiac sign (for choosing compatible work partners), course of study, add notes to further explain what they're wanting help studying for, and get a daily motivational encouragement.
